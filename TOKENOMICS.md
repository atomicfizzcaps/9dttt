# FIZZ Token Tokenomics - Fixed Supply Treasury Model

## 🪙 Token Overview

**Token Name**: FIZZ Token (Atomic Fizz Caps)  
**Total Supply**: 77,000,000 FIZZ (FIXED - pre-minted at launch)  
**Native Chain**: Solana (SPL Token)  
**Decimals**: 6  
**Distribution Model**: Treasury-Based (NO MINTING)  
**Additional Chains**: XRP Ledger, Ethereum (via bridge)

---

## 🏦 Treasury Distribution Model

### Core Principle
**All 77 million FIZZ tokens are pre-minted at launch and held in a treasury wallet.**

NO additional tokens will EVER be created. The treasury DISTRIBUTES tokens to players - it does NOT mint new ones.

### How It Works

```
Total Supply = 77,000,000 FIZZ (fixed forever)
Treasury Wallet = Holds all tokens
Distribution = Treasury SENDS tokens to players
```

**NOT burn-and-mint!** Instead:
1. **Treasury Holds**: All tokens pre-minted and secured
2. **Players Earn**: In-game rewards (virtual CAPS)
3. **Redemption**: Players claim real FIZZ from treasury
4. **Multi-Chain**: Treasury distributes on each chain

## 🎮 Two-Tier System

### 1. IN-GAME CAPS (Virtual Currency)

**What they are:**
- Server-side bookkeeping
- Virtual game currency
- NOT blockchain tokens
- Track gameplay progress

**How players earn:**
- Complete quests → Earn CAPS
- Win battles → Earn CAPS
- Discover locations → Earn CAPS
- Trade with NPCs → Earn CAPS

**Redis storage:**
```javascript
player:wallet:profile → { caps: 5000, ... }
```

### 2. REAL FIZZ TOKENS (Blockchain Assets)

**What they are:**
- Actual SPL tokens on Solana
- Real cryptocurrency
- Blockchain verified
- Can be traded/sold

**How players get them:**
- Redeem in-game CAPS for FIZZ
- Treasury sends tokens to player wallet
- Airdrop campaigns
- Special events

**Redemption example:**
```javascript
// Player has 1000 in-game CAPS
// Redeems for FIZZ tokens
Treasury sends: 100 FIZZ → Player wallet
In-game CAPS: 1000 → 0 (consumed)
```

---

## 🌉 Multi-Chain Distribution

### Lock-and-Unlock Bridge (NOT Burn-and-Mint!)

**XRP Treasury:** Holds X FIZZ  
**Solana Treasury:** Holds Y FIZZ  
**Ethereum Treasury:** Holds Z FIZZ  

**Total:** X + Y + Z = 77,000,000 FIZZ ✅

### Bridge Operations

**User bridges 100 FIZZ from Solana to Ethereum:**

1. **Lock** on Solana:
   - User sends 100 FIZZ to Solana treasury
   - Tokens LOCKED (not burned)
   - Solana treasury: Y + 100

2. **Unlock** on Ethereum:
   - Ethereum treasury sends 100 FIZZ to user
   - Tokens UNLOCKED (not minted)
   - Ethereum treasury: Z - 100

3. **Result:**
   - Total supply: Still 77M ✅
   - User has tokens on Ethereum
   - Treasuries balanced

**Example Flow:**
```
Initial State:
├─ XRP Treasury:      30,800,000 FIZZ
├─ Solana Treasury:   30,800,000 FIZZ
├─ Ethereum Treasury: 15,400,000 FIZZ
└─ Total:             77,000,000 FIZZ ✅

User bridges 5M from Solana to XRP:
├─ XRP Treasury:      35,800,000 FIZZ (+5M)
├─ Solana Treasury:   25,800,000 FIZZ (-5M)
├─ Ethereum Treasury: 15,400,000 FIZZ (unchanged)
└─ Total:             77,000,000 FIZZ ✅
```

## 💰 Bridge Fees & Treasury

**Fee Structure**: 1% per bridge transfer

**Fee Collection:**
- User bridges 1,000 FIZZ
- Fee: 10 FIZZ (1%)
- User receives: 990 FIZZ
- **Fee goes to treasury** (not burned!)

**Treasury grows from:**
- Bridge fees
- Trading fees (from Fizz.fun)
- Unclaimed redemptions
- Expired reward pools

---

## 🎮 Gaming Integration

### Reward Distribution

**Players earn IN-GAME CAPS** for gameplay:

**Crypto Quest:**
- 100 points = 1 in-game CAP
- Max 100 CAPS per game
- Redeem 10 CAPS = 1 FIZZ from treasury

**Pong:**
- 50 points = 1 in-game CAP
- Max 50 CAPS per game
- Redeem 10 CAPS = 1 FIZZ from treasury

**Backgammon:**
- 75 points = 1 in-game CAP
- Max 75 CAPS per game
- Redeem 10 CAPS = 1 FIZZ from treasury

### Redemption Process

```javascript
// Player gameplay
Play Crypto Quest → Score 1000 points
Earn → 10 in-game CAPS

// Player redemption
Request: Redeem 10 CAPS for FIZZ
Backend: Verify CAPS balance
Treasury: Send 1 FIZZ to player wallet
Update: Player CAPS - 10, FIZZ balance + 1
```

---

## 🔒 Security & Supply Verification

### Supply Monitoring

All treasuries monitored:
```javascript
const totalSupply = 
    await getXRPTreasuryBalance() + 
    await getSolanaTreasuryBalance() + 
    await getEthereumTreasuryBalance();

// Should always equal initial mint
assert(totalSupply === 77_000_000, 'Supply mismatch!');
```

### Audit Trail

Every distribution recorded:
- Treasury transaction hash
- Recipient address
- Amount sent
- Timestamp
- Reason (redemption, airdrop, reward)

### Treasury Security

**Multi-Sig Wallet:**
- Requires 3 of 5 signatures
- Time-locked withdrawals
- Rate limits on distributions
- Emergency pause functionality

## 📝 Technical Specifications

### XRP Ledger
```json
{
  "currency": "FIZZ",
  "issuer": "rXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "totalSupply": "77000000",
  "decimals": 6,
  "mintingDisabled": true
}
```

### Solana SPL Token
```rust
pub struct FizzToken {
    pub mint: Pubkey,
    pub decimals: u8,         // 6
    pub supply: u64,          // 77_000_000 * 10^6
    pub mint_authority: None, // Disabled after initial mint
}
```

### Ethereum ERC20
```solidity
contract FizzToken is ERC20, Ownable {
    uint256 public constant TOTAL_SUPPLY = 77_000_000 * 10**6;
    
    constructor() ERC20("Fizz Token", "FIZZ") {
        _mint(msg.sender, TOTAL_SUPPLY);
        // Renounce ownership to prevent future minting
        renounceOwnership();
    }
    
    // No mint function - supply is fixed forever
}
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **No Inflation**: Total supply capped at 77M forever
2. **No Minting**: After initial creation, no new tokens can be made
3. **Treasury Model**: All tokens held in secure wallets
4. **Distribution Only**: Treasury sends existing tokens
5. **Multi-Chain**: Same total supply, distributed across chains
6. **Verifiable**: All distributions are on-chain and auditable
7. **Two-Tier**: In-game CAPS (virtual) vs FIZZ (real blockchain tokens)

## 🚀 Launch Strategy

### Primary Launch: Solana (Native Chain)

**Why Solana First:**
- Native SPL token standard
- Low transaction fees (<$0.01)
- Fast confirmation times (~400ms)
- Strong DeFi ecosystem (Raydium, Orca, Jupiter)
- Gaming-friendly infrastructure

**Initial Liquidity Pool:**
```
Platform: Raydium
Pair: FIZZ/SOL
SOL Side: 5 SOL (~$500-750)
FIZZ Side: 5,000,000 FIZZ (6.5% of supply)
Target Price: $0.0001 per FIZZ
Initial Market Cap: ~$7.7M (fully diluted)
```

**Launch Timeline:**
1. **Week 1**: Deploy FIZZ on Solana, create liquidity pool
2. **Week 2-4**: Enable game redemptions, build community
3. **Month 2**: Bridge to XRP Ledger
4. **Month 3**: Bridge to Ethereum
5. **Ongoing**: Additional DEX listings and partnerships

### Cross-Chain Expansion

**Phase 2: XRP Ledger**
- Bridge liquidity from Solana treasury
- List on XRPL DEX and Sologenic
- Target: 4M FIZZ liquidity

**Phase 3: Ethereum**
- Deploy wrapped FIZZ as ERC20
- List on Uniswap V3
- Target: 2M FIZZ liquidity

**Bridge Mechanism:**
- Lock tokens on Solana treasury
- Unlock equivalent on target chain
- Maintain 77M total supply across all chains
